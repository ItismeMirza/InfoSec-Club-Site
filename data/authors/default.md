The InfoSec Club is a group of Bellevue College students that share a passion for the information security field. We offer events and competitions that are fun, engaging, and informative. We also provide study help for any InfoSec-related classes.

Our goal is to conduct and participate in infosec events and competitions as well as provide a community for security professionals, enthusiasts, and novices to network and support each other.

We offer study assistance for many information security related courses (e.g. ISIT, Prog, CS, Tech, NSCOM) and commercial certifications. We also provide a medium for students who are interested in or currently pursuing careers in cybersecurity to learn from each other, network, collect resources, and develop or refine skills.
