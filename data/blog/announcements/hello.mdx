# Deployed!

The BC InfoSec Club Site is now up! Thank you for stopping by to read this post. :)

# Fall 2022

Hi Everyone! I'm Vincent, the new President of the InfoSec Club. It's a new school year (sort of) and most of the club's old officers have gone off on their way to further their careers. Alongside with our newly elected officers, I'll be running this club and doing CTFs! We try to do them every weekend, so hope to see you guys there! Feel free to hop in at anytime, and say hello if your new! Happy Hacking!
